Dear All,
I hope this message finds you well. I am thrilled to reach out to you regarding the upcoming "Mixed Effects Modelling Workshop in R" scheduled on 28 February and 6 March. My name is Ehsan Solaimani, and I will be facilitating this workshop.

Above, you'll find the workshop materials. Please download and unzip the "GLMER_Workshop" to access the materials. To see a video tutorial of how to access the files, click on 'WATCH_ME.webm' -> 'view raw'. The contents include:


• Slides: Find the presentation slides in mixed_effects_modelling.html.

To ensure a smooth workshop experience, please make sure to install R and RStudio on your computer. Here are the installation instructions:
(a) Install R:


• Visit https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base

• Save the R 4.3.2.exe installer in your Downloads directory (or any other location of your choice on your computer).


• Double-click the file, run the software, and follow the on-screen instructions. Select English as the default language and keep clicking "Next" to accept the default settings. Wait for the installation to finish.


(b) Install RStudio:


• Visit https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download


• Download the RStudio Desktop installer corresponding to your operating system.


• Run the installer, click "Next"/"Keep," and "Install" as prompted. Wait for the installer to finish.


For those new to R, you may find this introductory YouTube video helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR-XRSKsuR4.
The video covers basic concepts and will help you get started with R before the workshop. Please note that you do not need to learn the commands in R but it is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the sort of possible functionalities in R.


I am enthusiastic about the workshop and look forward to meeting you all. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me at es19488@essex.ac.uk

Best regards,
Dr. Ehsan Solaimani
